Useful Phrases
“Good to see you!”

This is a nice way to greet someone when you haven’t seen them in a while.

“How’s it going?”

Bob replies to this question with “Yeah, good.” This might seem a little weird because Sam didn’t ask a yes or no question. But in this case, “yeah” doesn’t have any special meaning. It’s just a way to acknowledge Sam’s question and move on.

“Good for you!”
